# 🐾 Raffi.exe — Debugging Life One Commit at a Time 💻

> “Every bug is just a boss battle waiting to be defeated.” 🎮  

Hi! I'm **RapiWapu**, but you can call me **Raffi** — a 16-year-old high school student from **Indonesia** 🇮🇩.  
I’m still a complete **beginner** in the world of programming, but I have big dreams:  
- to become a **Full Stack Engineer** and earn a good living doing what I love 💻💡
- I’m also dreaming of creating my own 2D detective game with Unity —  currently learning everything step by step to make it real. 🎮

Right now, I’m using this GitHub to **build my own portfolio** and track my learning journey.  
I’m currently learning **Backend Development** using **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **C++**  
(C++ is also the language I use for my **Informatics Olympiad / OSN** 🧠).

Once I get comfortable with backend, I’ll move on to learn **Frontend** —  
starting with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Step by step, slowly but surely — and hopefully, I can stay consistent along the way 🚀

## ⚙️ About Me
- 🧠 Currently learning to become a **Backend Developer** first  
- 💡 Once I master the backend, I’ll move on to **Frontend** and aim to become a **Full Stack Engineer** someday 🚀  
- 🕹️ Working on my first game: *“My Past, My Enemy”* — a 2D mystery visual novel  
- 😂 Running on logic errors and hope 
- 😺 I dream of having a cat by my side someday —to help me hunt down bugs in my code. 🐾
